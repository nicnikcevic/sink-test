# SinkTest
SinkTest is a MVP of the Sink App, an IOS app to track and share games of Pong among Dartmouth students

# Current Bugs/Needed Fixes
- GameRecap field still needed in Game struct?
- Change the loading screen to hold the Sink logo
- The verb switching on the GameCarView should accomdate a "shrubbed" feature, right now it only calculates for "treed"
- some of the navigation links do not work: For example all displays of profiles should navigate to the users profile on click
- Functionality for liking and disliking games is built in, but there is no button

# Future Features

## Fundamental Functionality

- Algorithm
- Ranked Leaderboard
- More game types?
- A timer in between starting a game and inputting the results, to make inputting fake games more difficult

## UX convenience

- Recognize usernames as teamates and opponents are added to a game
- Delete a game
- Size limit for usernames

## Extra Additions
- GPT Generated game recaps/news section
- "Hall of Shame", displays all those who got treed/shrubbed for one week
